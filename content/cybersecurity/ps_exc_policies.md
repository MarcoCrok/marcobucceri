## üîπ What Are PowerShell Execution Policies?

PowerShell **execution policies** are security measures that control how scripts run on a system. They help prevent unauthorized or malicious scripts from executing. However, they are **not a security feature**‚Äîthey are a safety measure designed to **prevent accidental script execution** rather than block malicious code.

By default, execution policies are set to:
- **Restricted** on Windows client systems (no scripts allowed)
- **RemoteSigned** on Windows Server systems (scripts need a signature if downloaded)

To check the current execution policy on your machine, use the command:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

## üîπ PowerShell Execution Policy Types

PowerShell has several execution policies, each offering different levels of control and security.

### üîí **1. Restricted:** (Default for Windows Clients)
Blocks all scripts. Only interactive commands are allowed.

### ‚úÖ **2. RemoteSigned:** (Default for Windows Servers)
Allows locally created scripts but requires a trusted signature for downloaded ones.

### üîë **3. AllSigned:**
Requires all scripts to be signed by a trusted publisher, including local scripts.
Potential risk: If a malicious script is signed, it can still run.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **4. Unrestricted:**
Runs all scripts without restriction but warns for files from the internet.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **5. Bypass:**
Completely disables script blocking, useful for automated systems.

### üîÑ **6. Undefined:**
No execution policy is set in the current scope. Defaults to **Restricted (Windows Clients)** or **RemoteSigned (Windows Servers)**.

### üîÑ **7. Default:**
üñ•Ô∏è Sets the default execution policy based on system type:
- **Windows Client:** Restricted
- **Windows Server:** RemoteSigned

## üîπ Changing the Execution Policy

To modify the execution policy, use:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy <PolicyName>
```

For example, to set **RemoteSigned**:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Be careful** when changing execution policies, as setting them too leniently can expose your system to security risks.

## üîπ Scopes: Where Execution Policies Apply

Execution policies can be applied at different levels:

| Scope           | Description |
|----------------|------------|
| **MachinePolicy** | Set by Group Policy for all users. |
| **UserPolicy** | Set by Group Policy for the current user. |
| **Process** | Affects only the current PowerShell session. Disappears when closed. |
| **CurrentUser** | Affects only the current user. Stored in the Windows registry. |
| **LocalMachine** | Affects all users on the computer. Stored in the registry. |

To check execution policies across all scopes:
```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

To change the policy for a specific scope:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## üîπ Best Practices for Managing Execution Policies

1. **Use Restricted or RemoteSigned** to maintain security.
2. **Sign your scripts** using a trusted certificate.
3. **Use Process Scope** (`-Scope Process`) if you need a temporary policy change.
4. **Avoid using Bypass or Unrestricted** unless necessary for testing or automation.
5. **Audit execution policies** using Group Policy or PowerShell monitoring tools.

## üîπ Conclusion

Understanding **PowerShell Execution Policies** is crucial for balancing security and flexibility in script execution. By configuring them correctly, you can protect your system while still allowing necessary automation.
