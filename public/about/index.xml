At the age of two, I lost my mother, leaving my father with the full weight of the family on his shoulders, supported immensely by my aunt and older sisters. Despite the challenges, I had a peaceful upbringing, making my first friends at school and playing for the local football team.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My journey into IT began around 1996 when my father brought home a strange gray metal box, a screen resembling a TV, and a couple of peripherals—a mouse and a keyboard.&#xA;He set everything up on the desk, pressed the power button, and there it was—the magic of Windows 95. I was mesmerized.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
