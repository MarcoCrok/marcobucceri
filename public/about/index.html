            <p>Born in 1990, I grew up in a small, quiet seaside town in Sicily. At the age of two, I lost my mother, leaving my father with the full weight of the family on his shoulders, supported immensely by my aunt and older sisters. Despite the challenges, I had a peaceful upbringing, making my first friends at school and playing for the local football team.</p>
<p>My journey into IT began around 1996 when my father brought home a strange gray metal box, a screen resembling a TV, and a couple of peripherals—a mouse and a keyboard.
He set everything up on the desk, pressed the power button, and there it was—the magic of Windows 95. I was mesmerized.</p>
<p>From that moment on, the computer became mine (or so I believed). Initially, I used it for games like Flipball, Solitaire, and classics like Prince of Persia, loaded from floppy disks. Those were golden times!
With the arrival of the internet via a 56K modem, my curiosity exploded. I discovered online forums and, together with friends, started downloading music, games, and movies using eMule. We even delved into cracking software—a childhood curiosity that, looking back, sparked an interest in problem-solving and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>At 13 or 14, I landed my first part-time job at a local computer store and internet café. Thanks to Carlo, the owner, I built my first PCs from scratch. I still remember the challenge of setting up HDDs and configuring master and slave jumpers. Surrounded by cases, GPUs, CPUs, and tangled wires, I learned the art of troubleshooting hardware. We also installed some of the first Wi-Fi kits in homes, often failing because ISP-provided networks weren’t as straightforward as they seemed.
Fixing issues, setting up printers, configuring phones—this was my introduction to real-world IT. But summer ended, school resumed, and I had to say goodbye to the store. However, my name spread, and people in town kept calling me for tech support. Enthusiastically, I took on small jobs, fixing computers and networking issues, making a little extra cash along the way.</p>
<p>I enrolled in an industrial technical school specializing in IT, but I failed my first year due to clashes with teachers and my rebellious nature. Some teaching methods just didn’t align with my impatient, independent mindset at the time.
During this period, I picked up the guitar and fell in love with metal music. Playing covers of “Seek &amp; Destroy” and “Raining Blood” led to forming my first band with close friends. It was one of the best times of my life.
I later switched to a business school and graduated in 2009. But finding IT job opportunities in Sicily was almost impossible. So, I started working in my father’s company, moving from laborer to heavy machinery operator, eventually taking on office responsibilities.</p>
<p>After several years, I felt the need to carve my own path. I shifted industries, managing a beach resort in my hometown. It was a complete change, putting me in direct contact with hospitality and customer service. I gained recognition for my management skills and financial success in running the summer seasons.
Then, life took an unexpected turn—my father was diagnosed with cancer. After multiple surgeries and trips to Northern Italy for treatments, he seemed to recover. With a clearer mind, I made a bold decision: I moved to London in the spring of 2016.
Coming from a small town of just a few thousand people, London’s scale and energy were mesmerizing. It was love at first sight. Within a few weeks, I found work as a handyman. But my stay was cut short—bad news arrived. My father’s cancer had returned, this time more aggressively.
I went back to Sicily to support him. During this time, I worked as a welder, a craft that gave me immense creative satisfaction. When my father’s condition stabilized, I returned to London, continuing my welding career for several companies.</p>
<p>Then, fate introduced me to my life partner, now the mother of my child. Alice became my rock—my inspiration. Without her, I wouldn’t be who I am today. She was, and still is, my life coach.</p>
<p>Summer 2019: I traveled back to Sicily for a short vacation with my partner. On August 28th, my father lost his battle. The grief was overwhelming, but in some ways, his suffering had been too great. Perhaps, in the end, it was a release for him.
With the support of Alice, friends, and family, I found the strength to move forward. Then, life threw another curveball. On the day of my father’s funeral, my employer remotely fired me due to financial difficulties in the company. That moment ignited a fire in me—the determination to change my life.</p>
<p>Then came January 2020—the COVID-19 pandemic. My company shut down, leaving me unemployed again. But instead of falling into despair, I seized the opportunity to reinvent myself.
Over the next six months, I dedicated myself to intense study—my first time studying in English. I earned my CompTIA A+ and Google IT Support Professional certifications. Discipline, sacrifice, and a thirst for redemption paid off.
By June 2020, I was back to work as a welder. But in March 2021, we made another big move—this time to France, near the Swiss border, Alice’s homeland.
Life here was different—calmer, more balanced. I continued studying, earning my CompTIA Network+ certification while sending my CV to companies in Geneva, aiming for an IT helpdesk role.</p>
<p>By May, I landed an internship as an IT Support Technician for two major international companies. Finally, I was applying my knowledge—setting up workstations, troubleshooting user issues, repairing hardware. Coming from a completely different industry, it was a brutal but exhilarating transition.
I completed my internship in August, securing my first official IT job as a Level 2 IT Support Technician at a Swiss MSP, supporting two global enterprises in Geneva. This was a whole new level—fast-paced, high-pressure. Supporting over 2,000 users, I handled everything from routine password resets to critical network outages, collaborating closely with the networking team to resolve major incidents.</p>
<p>In 2022, I received an award from one of the companies I supported, recognized as one of the top IT professionals in their Finance &amp; Administration Division—an incredible milestone.</p>
<p>But the greatest gift of all arrived in October—my son Killian was born. Nothing could match that joy.</p>
<p>In 2023, I stepped into a new role as IT Support Team Coordinator. I managed task orchestration, incident handling, and direct reporting to my manager. My responsibilities expanded to include networking investigations, high-impact incidents, and VIP support.</p>
<p>By mid-2024, I was promoted to IT Support Specialist—a role I proudly hold today.</p>
<p>There’s still so much to say. I’ve tried to summarize as best as possible, but I’m sure I’ve left out some pieces of my journey. What’s certain is that there are still many challenges to tackle and successes to achieve.
Let’s see what the future holds! 😊</p>
